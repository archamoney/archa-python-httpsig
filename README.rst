Sign HTTP requests with secure signatures according to the IETF HTTP Signatures specification (`Draft 12`_).  This is a fork of the original module_ to fully support both RSA and HMAC schemes as well as unit test both schemes to prove they work.  It's being used in production and is actively-developed.

See the original project_, original Python module_, original spec_, and `current IETF draft`_ for more details on the signing scheme.

For testing:

* tox
* pyenv (optional, handy way to access multiple versions)

Usage
-----

Real documentation is forthcoming, but for now this should get you started.

For simple raw signing:

.. code:: python

    import httpsig
    
    secret = open('rsa_private.pem', 'rb').read()
    
    sig_maker = httpsig.Signer(secret=secret, algorithm='hs2019', sign_algorithm=httpsig.PSS())
    sig_maker.sign('hello world!')

For general use with web frameworks:
    
.. code:: python

    import httpsig
    import DEFAULT_ALGORITHM from settings
    key_id = "Some Key ID"
    secret = "Some Secret"
    
    hs = httpsig.HeaderSigner(key_id, secret, algorithm="hs2019", sign_algorithm=DEFAULT_ALGORITHM, headers=['(request-target)', 'host', '(created)'])
    signed_headers_dict = hs.sign({"(created)": "1392617465", "Host": "example.com"}, method="GET", path="/api/1/object/1")

For use with requests:

.. code:: python

    import json
    import requests
    from httpsig.requests_auth import HTTPSignatureAuth
    
    secret = open('rsa_private.pem', 'rb').read()
    
    auth = HTTPSignatureAuth(key_id='Test', secret=secret, sign_algorithm=httpsig.PSS())
    z = requests.get('https://api.example.com/path/to/endpoint', 
                             auth=auth, headers={'X-Api-Version': '~6.5', 'Date': 'Tue, 01 Jan 2014 01:01:01 GMT')

Class initialization parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that keys and secrets should be bytes objects.  At attempt will be made to convert them, but if that fails then exceptions will be thrown.

.. code:: python

    httpsig.Signer(secret, algorithm='hs2019', sign_algorithm=DEFAULT_ALGORITHM)

``secret``, in the case of an RSA signature, is a string containing private RSA pem. In the case of HMAC, it is a secret password.  
``algorithm`` should be set to 'hs2019' the other six signatures are now deprecated: ``rsa-sha1``, ``rsa-sha256``, ``rsa-sha512``, ``hmac-sha1``, ``hmac-sha256``,
``hmac-sha512``.
``sign_algorithm`` The digital signature algorithm derived from ``keyId``. Currently supported algorithms: ``hmac-sha512``


.. code:: python

    httpsig.requests_auth.HTTPSignatureAuth(key_id, secret, algorithm='hs2019', sign_algorithm=DEFAULT_ALGORITHM, headers=None)

``key_id`` is the label by which the server system knows your secret.
``headers`` is the list of HTTP headers that are concatenated and used as signing objects. By default it is the specification's minimum, the ``(created)`` HTTP header.
``secret`` and ``algorithm`` are as above.
``sign_algorithm`` The digital signature algorithm derived from ``keyId``. Currently supported algorithms: ``hmac-sha512``

Tests
-----

To run tests::

    python setup.py test

or::

    tox

Known Limitations
-----------------

1. Multiple values for the same header are not supported. New headers with the same name will overwrite the previous header. It might be possible to replace the CaseInsensitiveDict with the collection that the email package uses for headers to overcome this limitation.
2. Keyfiles with passwords are not supported. There has been zero vocal demand for this so if you would like it, a PR would be a good way to get it in.
3. Draft 2 added support for ecdsa-sha256. This is available in PyCryptodome but has not been added to httpsig. PRs welcome.
